# dx12-starter

## Requirements

- Windows 10+
- DirectX 12
- Visual Studio 2022 (not hard requirement)

## Getting Started

Clone this project: ``

Then we can setup external dependencies (like the GLFW library).

### Setup External Dependencies

Currently project has binary included but will eventually `.gitignore` them, so this is how you'd set up the external dependencies.

Download GLFW pre-built binaries and extract to `include` and `lib` folders.

### Running Project

Once the dependencies are setup, you can run the project using the source code.

1. Open the `.sln`.
1. Run the build.
